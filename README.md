# Project

This project is a simple list with some features like adding, removing and modifying items. It was thought and developed to solve a family problem.

The problem is that some couples were weddings and organizing a party to give gifts to them is hard to manage by WhatsApp group. Some problems that happen are loose information, gift assigners duplication, one person to manage the list, and difficulty knowing what is the latest list.

## API Backend

The backend is developed by [Arthur Soares](https://github.com/Arthur-ext) in the following repository [Wedding Gift API](https://github.com/Arthur-ext/wedding-gifts-api)

## API Mock

To start the project with API mock you just need to run `npm run start:local`

## Integrations

This repository uses [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and [Checkly](https://www.checklyhq.com).

### Vercel

Vercel is used to administrate the deployment and available the app for the internet. On the top of this README you can see the badge showing you the latest status.

Vercel is enabled to generate a deployment always for pull requests (generating an auto link preview) and when its pull requests are merged, also running a deployment but it is for production.

### Checkly

Checkly is used to monitoring the app periodically checking it's status check with scenarios that you can build like a E2E tests. For a while, this project is checked in each 24 hours. In the top of this readme you can see the badge showing you the latest status.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
